This is an app which helps to find a good movie to watch at the weekend, after work or during downtime.
It offers detailed information about the selected movie (a poster image, user's score, short describtion, cast and reviews). 
It also allows searching for a movie by a keyword. 
The app was created in order to practice routing. In particular I enjoyed exploring the SharedLayout approach. 
I find it very useful for optimized rendering of repetitive components of a page - in my app it's header with navbar. 
I really enjoyed how the useSearchParams hook enabled me to implement logic for fetching events by query. 
The useParams hook which is used to get id value from URL is equally fascinating. 
The app uses react-routing-dom and axios libraries as well as the TMDB API.
